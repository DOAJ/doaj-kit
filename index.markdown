Consistency, accessibility, and performance are at the core of DOAJ’s UI redesign.

### In art

Our main design choices were inspired by visuals from artists at the intersection of art & science and guided by three attributes defined for DOAJ: far-reaching, honest, and reliable.

Movement and colour palette  
— Bridget Riley’s op art

Bold colour blocks and expressiveness  
— Matisse’s cut-outs

Repetition, musical patterns, and scale  
— Agnès Martin’s minimalism

Structured grid and objectivity  
— Swiss Style / International Typographic Style
