This living document is the beginning of a basic kit for designing and developing DOAJ.org’s pages. Eventually, it will be elaborated to include collaterals (PDF reports, presentation decks, e-mail headers) and social media assets. An [article about The Economist’s design system](https://medium.com/severe-contest/how-were-establishing-a-new-visual-language-for-the-economist-3e164c233390) defines it as such:

> A design system is a living document in software and code. It is always up to date and new releases are immediately available to other products; a so-called “single source of truth”. As well as including all brand attributes and interface components, a design system contains the principles, standards and best practices to deliver a consistent user experience.

Consistency, accessibility, and performance are at the core of DOAJ’s UI redesign. This document will help us make sure that we are meeting these three requirements.
