DOAJ’s _Manuscript_ is an evolving document. This is where we will publish our basic design system kit for creating and developing DOAJ.org’s user interface. Eventually, it will be elaborated to include collaterals (PDF reports, presentation decks, e-mail headers) and social media assets. An [article about The Economist’s design system](https://medium.com/severe-contest/how-were-establishing-a-new-visual-language-for-the-economist-3e164c233390) defines it as such:

> A design system is a living document in software and code. It is always up to date and new releases are immediately available to other products; a so-called “single source of truth”. As well as including all brand attributes and interface components, a design system contains the principles, standards and best practices to deliver a consistent user experience.

Consistency, accessibility, and performance are at the core of DOAJ’s UI redesign. This document will help us make sure that we are meeting these three requirements.
