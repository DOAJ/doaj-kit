For consistency, the [Feather icon set](https://feathericons.com/) will be the only set of icons used. As with the typefaces, it is a free and open source set of icons that is continually being updated.

It offers an extensive choice of elegant, minimal and understated icons for use on DOAJâ€™s website and collaterals (PDF, etc.) while covering basic UI actions (close, expand, minimise, ascend, descend).
