### Palette

The palette plays on a polychromatic selection of hues, with an inclination for warmer colours.

We’ve kept the colour orange, a reminder of PLOS’ Open Access orange and a colour familiar to DOAJ’s user base, but it has matured into a darker burnt orange shade as well as softer light orange tint.

### Proportions

Generally, every page on the website should adhere to the following proportions (collaterals like PDF reports may deviate from this, to use full-page blocks of colours for example):

{% include blocks/colour-proportions.html %}

- 80% greyscale:
  - Warm White
  - Warm Black
- 20% colours:
  - Teal & Pine Green
  - Orange & Burnt Orange
  - Crimson & Venetian Red

### Accessible combinations

Not all colours can be mixed together if we want content to be accessible for users with colour vision deficiencies (CVDs). Graphical and non-essential page elements (i.e. not required to understand the content) are not bound by these combinations.

The following are the acceptable (WCAG AA-compliant) combinations of colours for text and background.
