## Palette

The palette plays on a polychromatic selection of hues, with an inclination for warmer colours.

We’ve kept the colour orange, a reminder of PLOS’ Open Access orange and a colour familiar to DOAJ’s user base, but it has matured into a darker burnt orange shade as well as softer light orange tint.

## Proportions

Generally, every page on the website should adhere to the following proportions (collaterals like PDF reports may deviate from this, to use full-page blocks of colours for example):

{% include blocks/colour-proportions.html %}

- 80% greyscale:
  - Warm White
  - Warm Black
- 20% colours:
  - Teal & Pine Green
  - Orange & Burnt Orange
  - Crimson & Venetian Red

## Accessible combinations

Not all colours can be mixed together if we want content to be accessible for users with colour vision deficiencies (CVDs). Graphical and non-essential page elements (i.e. not required to understand the content) are not bound by these combinations.

The following are the acceptable (WCAG AA-compliant) combinations of colours for text and background.

## Themes (WIP)

Although the palette includes three different hues (orange, crimson, and teal), we recommend using a single hue per page.

Each colour can be associated with three types of pages, depending on their general objective:
1. **Burnt orange**: learning about what we do
   - News
   - FAQs
   - Privacy
   - About…
2. **Venetian red**: submitting an application
   - Apply
   - For Publishers
   - Copyright & Licensing Help…
3. **Pine green**: accessing the content
   - Search
   - Widgets
   - OAI-PMH
   - API…
