## Palette

The palette plays on a polychromatic selection of hues, with an inclination for warmer colours.

We’ve kept the colour orange, a reminder of PLOS’ Open Access orange and a colour familiar to DOAJ’s user base, but it has matured into a darker burnt orange shade as well as softer light orange tint.

Generally, every page on the website should adhere to the following proportions. Collaterals like PDF reports may deviate from this, to use full-page blocks of colours for example.
