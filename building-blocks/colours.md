Generally, every page on the website should adhere to the following colour proportions.

{% include blocks/colour-proportions.html %}

Collaterals like PDF reports may deviate from this, to use full-page blocks of colours for example.

## Accessible combinations

Not all colours can be mixed together if we want content to be accessible for users with colour vision deficiencies (CVDs). Graphical and non-essential page elements (i.e. not required to understand the content) are not bound by these combinations.

The following are the acceptable (WCAG AA-compliant) combinations of colours for text and background.
