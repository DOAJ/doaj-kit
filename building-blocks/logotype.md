⟶ [Download](/files/DOAJ_Logos_Digital.zip) all four variations of the logo in SVG and PNG.

Please make sure to **always** leave white space around the logotype: the exclusion zone (or _safe area_) should measure about half of the height of the **O** in _DOAJ_.

**DO NOT**:
- Modify the logo in any way
- Change the logo’s colours
- Add any graphics to it
- Stretch it out of proportion
